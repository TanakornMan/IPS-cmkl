ABSTRACT = {Indoor localization systems are used to locate mobile devices inside buildings where traditional solutions, such as the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), do not work well due to the lack of direct visibility to the satellites. Fingerprinting is one of the most known solutions for indoor localization. It is based on the Received Signal Strength (RSS) of packets transmitted among mobile devices and anchor nodes. However, RSS values are known to be unstable and noisy due to obstacles and the dynamicity of the scenarios, causing inaccuracies in the position estimations. This instability and noise often cause the system to indicate a location that it is not quite sure is correct, although it is the most likely based on the calculations. This property of RSS can cause algorithms to return a localization with a low confidence level. If we could choose more reliable results, we would have an overall result with better quality. Thus, in our solution, we created a checking phase of the confidence level of the localization result. For this, we use the prediction probability provided by KNN and the novelty detection to discard classifications that are not very reliable and often wrong. In this work, we propose LocFiND (Localization using Fingerprinting and Novelty Detection), a fingerprint-based solution that uses prediction probability and novelty detection to evaluate the confidence of the estimated positions and mitigate inaccuracies caused by RSS in the localization phase. We implemented our solution in a real-world, large-scale school area using Bluetooth-based devices. Our performance evaluation shows considerable improvement in the localization accuracy and stability while discarding only a few, low confidence estimations.},

ABSTRACT = {In an indoor positioning system (IPS), transfer learning (TL) methods are commonly used to predict the location of mobile devices under the assumption that all training instances of the target domain are given in advance. However, this assumption has been criticized for its shortcomings in dealing with the problem of signal distribution variations, especially in a dynamic indoor environment. The reasons are: collecting a sufficient number of training instances is costly, the training instances may arrive online, the feature spaces of the target and source domains may be different, and negative knowledge may be transferred in the case of a redundant source domain. In this work, we proposed an online heterogeneous transfer learning (OHetTLAL) algorithm for IPS-based RSS fingerprinting to improve the positioning performance in the target domain by fusing both source and target domain knowledge. The source domain was refined based on the target domain to avoid negative knowledge transfer. The co-occurrence measure of the feature spaces (Cmip) was used to derive the homogeneous new feature spaces, and the features with higher weight values were selected for training the classifier because they could positively affect the location prediction of the target. Thus, the objective function was minimized over the new feature spaces. Extensive experiments were conducted on two real-world scenarios of datasets, and the predictive power of the different modeling techniques were evaluated for predicting the location of a mobile device. The results have revealed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for fingerprint-based indoor positioning and is found robust to changing environments. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is not only resilient to fluctuating environments but also mitigates the model's overfitting problem.},

ABSTRACT = {The number of older people needing healthcare is a growing global phenomenon. The assistance in long-term care comprises a complex of medical, nursing, rehabilitation, and social assistance services. The cost is substantial, but technology can help reduce spending by ensuring efficient health services and improving the quality of life. Advances in artificial intelligence, wireless communication systems, and nanotechnology allow the creation of intelligent home care systems avoiding hospitalization with evident cost containment. They are capable of ensuring functions of recognition of activities, monitoring of vital functions, and tracking. However, it is essential to also have information on location in order to be able to promptly intervene in case of unforeseen events or assist people in carrying out activities in order to avoid incorrect behavior. In addition, the automatic detection of physical activities performed by human subjects is identified as human activity recognition (HAR). This work presents an overview of the positioning system as part of an integrated HAR system. Lastly, this study contains each technology’s concepts, features, accuracy, advantages, and limitations. With this work, we want to highlight the relationship between HAR and the indoor positioning system (IPS), which is poorly documented in the literature.},
